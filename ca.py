expected_output: >
  A structured response in Markdown that answers the user’s question using only the content retrieved via the search tool.  
  The output must follow the `analysis_plan` exactly — for example:
  
  - A **ranked list** (e.g., “Top 5 most common services”)
  - A **summary** (e.g., a paragraph with key findings)
  - A **comparison table** (e.g., average rates by role and vendor)

  Use bullet points or tables where applicable.  
  Do **not** include any generated assumptions, external knowledge, or interpretations not grounded in the retrieved data.
