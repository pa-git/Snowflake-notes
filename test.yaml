review_ocr_text:
  description: >
    Review the provided OCR-extracted text from the PDF. Your task is to reformat any sections that were originally in tables so that the text becomes coherent and accurately reflects the original content. Follow these guidelines:
    - Maintain numerical accuracy (e.g., interpret "USD 0.000" strictly as USD 0.000).
    - Preserve the original context and meaning.
    Input: OCR-extracted text delimited by triple backticks: ```{ocr_text}```
  expected_output: >
    A revised version of the OCR-extracted text with improved formatting and coherent structure, especially in areas that originated from tables.
  agent: ocr_text_reviewer

analyze_ocr_text:
  description: >
    Analyze the reviewed OCR-extracted text to extract all relevant contract details. Focus on identifying the nature of the service, skills provided, pricing details (including rates or unit prices), location-based rate variations, conditions, responsibilities, delivery model, term, duration, and any other pertinent details. This analysis will form a structured data summary.
    Inputs:
      - Reviewed OCR text from the previous task (review_ocr_text)
      - File name delimited by triple backticks: ```{file_name}```
  expected_output: >
    A JSON object containing all the extracted contract details, including the file name.
  agent: ocr_text_analyzer
  context:
    - review_ocr_text

analyze_text:
  description: >
    Analyze the extracted text (non-OCR) to extract all relevant contract details. Focus on identifying the nature of the service, skills provided, pricing details (including rates or unit prices), location-based rate variations, conditions, responsibilities, delivery model, term, duration, and any other pertinent details. This analysis will form a structured data summary.
    Inputs:
      - Extracted text delimited by triple backticks: ```{text}```
      - File name delimited by triple backticks: ```{file_name}```
  expected_output: >
    A JSON object containing all the extracted contract details, including the file name.
  agent: text_analyzer

consolidate_json:
  description: >
    Review the JSON outputs from both the OCR-extracted text analysis and the non-OCR text analysis. Compare the two to identify any discrepancies or missing information, then consolidate the data to produce a final, verified JSON object that accurately reflects all available contract details.
    Inputs:
      - JSON output from analyze_ocr_text
      - JSON output from analyze_text
  expected_output: >
    A final, verified, and consolidated JSON object containing complete contract information. Respond with only the JSON object, without any additional formatting such as triple backticks or markdown indicators.
