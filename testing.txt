## ðŸ§  Knowledge Graph Design for Contract RAG Use Case

### ðŸ“Œ Key Nodes
These are the primary entities in the knowledge graph:

- `Contract`
- `Role`
- `Project`
- `Division`
- `Initiative`
- `Resource` (Named individual or consultant)
- `Vendor`
- `SLA`
- `Service`
- `Rate`
- `Cost`
- `FTE`
- `FR ID`
- `Job Description`
- `Spend Bucket`

---

### ðŸ”— Key Relationships
These define how the nodes are connected:

- `Contract` **HAS_ROLE** â†’ `Role`
- `Contract` **HAS_SLA** â†’ `SLA`
- `Contract` **PROVIDES_SERVICE** â†’ `Service`
- `Contract` **INVOLVES_VENDOR** â†’ `Vendor`
- `Contract` **ASSOCIATED_WITH** â†’ `Division` / `Initiative`
- `Role` **ASSOCIATED_WITH** â†’ `Project`
- `Role` **FILLED_BY** â†’ `Resource`
- `Resource` **RECYCLED_IN** â†’ `Contract`
- `Vendor` **PROVIDES_ROLE_FOR** â†’ `Job Description`
- `SLA` **DEFINED_FOR** â†’ `Vendor`
- `SLA` **ASSOCIATED_WITH** â†’ `Service`
- `Role` **HAS_RATE** â†’ `Rate`
- `Role` **HAS_COST** â†’ `Cost`
- `Contract` **PART_OF_BUCKET** â†’ `Spend Bucket`
- `Contract` **HAS_SUMMARY** â†’ `Text`
- `Contract` **HAS_FR_ID** â†’ `FR ID`

---

### âœ… Why a Knowledge Graph Is Ideal for This Use Case

- **Rich relationship modeling**  
  Enables chaining through entities like vendor â†’ SLA â†’ contract â†’ role for complex insights.

- **Flexible schema**  
  Supports variable contract structures (e.g., some may lack SLAs or named resources).

- **Efficient reuse tracking**  
  Graphs naturally track how often the same consultant is used across contracts.

- **Semantically enriched retrieval**  
  Ideal for finding "similar roles", cost trends, or vendor-role-service combinations.

- **Exploratory querying**  
  Useful for analysis like grouping contracts by spend or filtering by project/initiative.

- **Temporal reasoning**  
  Supports modeling of contracts and roles that "roll off" and "pick up" at different times.
