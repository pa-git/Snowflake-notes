Slide 1: The Problem
Speaker Notes:

Let’s start with the problem.

Throughout the year, the Investor Relations team has to go through dozens of earnings call transcripts and conference call notes. Why?
To produce peer outlook and guidance commentary—documents that summarize what other players in the industry are saying about key themes.

For example:
What is JP Morgan saying about deposits and lending? What’s Goldman Sachs saying about expenses?

Now imagine reading multiple 20-page transcripts, each filled with dense financial language, just to pull out a few relevant quotes.

This process is not just tedious—it’s incredibly time-consuming. Hours and hours per document.

Slide 2: The Solution
Speaker Notes:

This is where our new tool comes in—the Investor Relations Quote Tool.

We built it closely with the IR team to solve this exact pain point.

It’s a multi-agent GenAI system that reads these long transcripts for you and extracts the most relevant quotes around the themes you care about. What normally takes days, now takes minutes.

Let me walk you through how it works.

First, the user selects a transcript—let’s say the most recent earnings call.

Then, they pick the themes they want to focus on—say "expenses" or "lending."

Hit Submit.

From there, the system goes to work. It reads the document, understands the context, pulls the quotes that match your themes—and delivers the results back in just a few minutes.

No more hours of skimming. Just the insights you need.

Slide 3: The Outcome
Speaker Notes:

Once the quotes are extracted, the IR team can quickly scan, edit, and condense them into the final commentary document.

This is a great example of how GenAI can automate a high-effort, high-value task—saving teams hours of manual work, and freeing them up to focus on more strategic decisions.

In short:
Faster insights. Better decisions. Less manual work.

Thank you!
