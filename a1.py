When analyzing the contract, avoid high-level or generic descriptions. Instead, provide **concrete, detailed answers**:

* **Summarize** only what is **explicitly stated** in the document, not just the section titles.
* When mentioning **overtime**, specify exactly **when and how it is triggered**.
* If referring to indexes like the **Labor Statistics Cost Index**, name the **full title, version, and how it is applied**.
* In all **exceptions**, list out what is actually excluded or treated differently—don’t just say "exceptions are noted".

Aim for **precise language**, including numbers, named entities, and examples. **Do not generalize.**
