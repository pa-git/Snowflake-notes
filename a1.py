Here is an executive summary of the key areas identified for improvement based on the feedback review across all images:

---

## **Executive Summary: Contract Parsing and Knowledge Graph Enhancements**

### 1. **Fee and Financial Accuracy**

* **Issues Identified**: Incorrect total/average dollar values, missing or inconsistent fee breakdowns, inaccurate hours-to-cost mappings, and unspecified currencies.
* **Improvements Planned**:

  * Introduce a **Fee Standardization Task** to align fee data with contract contents.
  * Add **tabular presentations** for clarity and consistency.
  * Validate **base fees, payment dates**, and match all fees to actual contract events.

---

### 2. **Role and Resource Standardization**

* **Issues Identified**: Incomplete or misleading role listings, lack of detail (e.g., number of resources, rate, total fees), and misrepresented role hours.
* **Improvements Planned**:

  * Implement a **Role Standardization Task** with enriched metadata (type, group, location).
  * Parse **seniority levels** and **hours committed** more precisely.
  * Distinguish between **roles and resources** and validate counts with SMEs.

---

### 3. **Legal and Entity Metadata**

* **Issues Identified**: Ambiguities in legal entity mapping and inability to accurately retrieve contracts by signer.
* **Improvements Planned**:

  * Add **legal entity standardization** via MS Entity Codes.
  * Introduce a **disambiguation mechanism** to group contracts signed by the same person.

---

### 4. **Services and Deliverables Parsing**

* **Issues Identified**: Vague or incomplete summaries, missing service days, and confusing quantity designations.
* **Improvements Planned**:

  * Define **clear service quantities**, normalize service day estimates.
  * Introduce **dedicated parsing steps** for services, deliverables, and invoices with proper mappings.

---

### 5. **Quality Assurance and Data Validation**

* **Issues Identified**: Hallucinations in summary, inconsistent start dates, and general lack of quality control in some parsing outcomes.
* **Improvements Planned**:

  * Add a **QA step** focused on hallucination detection and summary completeness.
  * Validate **metadata like contract start dates** for accuracy.

---

### 6. **Summary and Interpretation Improvements**

* **Issues Identified**: Summaries lack detailed descriptions, and exception/notes parsing is overly condensed or incomplete.
* **Improvements Planned**:

  * Enhance **summary generation** to include scope, services, and responsibilities.
  * Add a robust **exceptions and notes parser** to capture edge cases like T\&E applicability or overtime definitions.

---

### 7. **Workflows and Parsing Step Refinements**

* **Cross-cutting Enhancements**:

  * Each improvement area is being incorporated into a **dedicated workflow task**, such as new role parsing, fee standardization, cash plan creation, or contract metadata validation.
  * Tasks are prioritized based on impact and feasibility, with **high-priority fixes** targeted for early sprints (e.g., financials, legal entities).

These initiatives are part of a broader push to improve data reliability, parsing accuracy, and contextual understanding within the contract processing pipeline. This will lead to higher fidelity in the knowledge graph and improved user satisfaction in querying and using contract data.
