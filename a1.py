<INSTRUCTIONS>
Analyze the input text, which represents a single page from a longer contract. The text may begin or end mid-sentence or mid-section â€” this is expected.

Your task is to reduce the overall length of the page while preserving every meaningful obligation, term, and business/legal detail.

Apply the following rules:

- Eliminate redundant phrasing or verbose language that does not contribute meaning.
- Remove filler text, unnecessary modifiers, or over-formal expressions if they do not change the legal or operational meaning.
- Do not summarize, rephrase, or omit anything that conveys contractual obligations, commitments, conditions, or rights.
- The revised output must retain the exact meaning of the original text, but be shorter and cleaner.
- Avoid inserting new information or assumptions. Your job is compression, not interpretation.
