rules:
  - Only use ROLE_GROUP values from the provided list
  - Assign every role title to exactly one group
  - Choose the closest semantic match for each title
  - Use "Not Applicable" for:
      - Personal names (e.g., "John Doe", "Swapnil Gupta")
      - Entries that clearly do not represent job roles
  - Use "Other" only when:
      - The role is a valid job title but does not clearly fit into any existing category
      - You are unable to confidently assign it to one of the predefined groups
  - Do not invent new group names or modify existing ones
