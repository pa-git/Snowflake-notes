Compute average rates separately for each country, city, and level, within each currency. Do not combine across currencies or locations. Exclude zero or invalid values. Include country, city, level, currency, and average in the output.

Fees and rates vary by country, city, level, and currency. Always group and process them accordingly to ensure accurate sums and averages. Never aggregate across currencies without conversion.
