✅ Top Fit: Hasti Nafisi
Key Strengths:

Direct experience building multi-agent systems using LangChain and Landgraph frameworks.

Extensive LLM architecture and RAG pattern implementation.

Strong grasp of LLM-to-database pipelines, which is highly relevant for dynamic agent behavior based on structured/unstructured data.

Solid exposure to LangChain, FastAPI, vector DBs, and deployment pipelines.

Proven ability to design prompt engineering workflows, crucial in orchestrating agent behavior.

This profile is purpose-built for LLM-based multi-agent programming in Python.

⚠️ Close Second: Soude Ghari
Strong in LLM orchestration, prompt design, LangChain, and infrastructure.

Hands-on experience with retrieval-augmented generation, containerization, and FastAPI deployments.

Built multiple intelligent assistants, but less explicit on multi-agent orchestration.

Great LLM experience, but not as explicitly focused on multi-agent systems as Hasti.
