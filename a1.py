2) **Search Query**:
- Provide the search term for a semantic search against the contracts data. The query should be specific (e.g., a role title like "Data Analyst" or a service like "Application Testing")â€”do not use general terms like "services" or "roles".  
- Leave it empty only when retrieving an entire section across all contracts.
