Here’s the improved version of the requirements, structured for clarity and completeness:

---

# **Role**  
You are an experienced Streamlit UI Developer.

---

# **Task**  
Develop a Streamlit-based UI for a Python application that processes PDFs and extracts relevant quotes based on user-selected themes.

---

# **Requirements**

### **1. Application Overview**  
The Python application processes a list of PDFs, extracting relevant quotes based on selected themes. The user interface should allow users to select PDFs and themes, submit the processing job, monitor progress, and review and approve extracted quotes.

---

### **2. User Interface Features**  

#### **2.1 PDF Selection**  
- Display a list of available PDFs for the user to select.  
- Users can select between **5 to 10 PDFs** for processing.

#### **2.2 Theme Selection**  
- Present a list of **12 predefined themes** (e.g., Inflation, Income, AI).  
- Users can select up to **5 themes** per processing session.

#### **2.3 Submission Process**  
- After selecting PDFs and themes, users will click a **Submit** button to start the processing.  
- The selected PDFs and themes should be passed as inputs to the backend Python script.

---

### **3. Processing Logic & Status Updates**  

#### **3.1 Processing Order**  
- PDFs are processed sequentially.  
- For each PDF, all selected themes are processed before moving to the next PDF.  
  - Example: If processing 5 PDFs and 2 themes, the script processes:  
    - PDF #1 → Theme #1, Theme #2  
    - PDF #2 → Theme #1, Theme #2  
    - … and so on.

#### **3.2 Progress Monitoring**  
- Include a **"Logs" tab** showing real-time logs of the processing steps.  
- Provide a **progress bar** indicating overall processing completion.

---

### **4. Displaying Results**  

#### **4.1 Quote Extraction Output**  
- Upon processing each PDF-theme combination, the script outputs **5 extracted quotes**.

#### **4.2 Dynamic Tabs**  
- For each processed PDF, **create a new tab** in the UI named after the PDF.  
- **All quotes from all selected themes for that PDF** should be displayed in the same tab.  
- Each PDF tab is created as soon as the first theme for that PDF is completed.

---

### **5. Quote Review & Approval**  

#### **5.1 Quote Approval Interface**  
- Within each PDF tab:  
  - Display the **5 extracted quotes per theme**.  
  - Allow the user to **select quotes** they wish to **approve** using checkboxes or toggle buttons.  

#### **5.2 Resubmission Capability**  
- Users should be able to **modify their approvals** and **resubmit** selections if desired.  
- Approved quotes should be sent back to the backend Python script for final processing.

---

### **6. Additional Considerations**  
- Ensure the UI remains **responsive** during the processing.  
- Logs and status updates should be **real-time** and **non-blocking** to user interaction.  
- Design the UI to be **intuitive**, **clean**, and **user-friendly**.

This version clarifies functionality, organizes sections for quick understanding, and ensures the developer has a clear, actionable guide.
