    Generate a detailed Markdown report from the consolidated JSON object containing the contract information. Follow these precise guidelines:

    1. **Clear Structure**:  
       - Use concise and informative headings (`#`, `##`, `###`) to reflect the hierarchy of content.
       - Each heading must clearly summarize the content beneath it.

    2. **Content Granularity**:  
       - Divide the content into logical sections, each clearly representing a single coherent topic or subtopic.
       - Ensure paragraphs focus exclusively on one central idea each.

    3. **Bullet Points and Lists**:  
       - Employ bullet points (`-`) or numbered lists (`1.`, `2.`, `3.`) for clear representation of sequences, steps, or enumerations.

    4. **Tables**:  
       - Represent structured data, such as rates, skills, pricing by location, or conditions, using Markdown tables to enhance readability.

    5. **Important Concepts and Terms**:  
       - Bold (`**bold text**`) key concepts, critical terms, or phrases that clearly capture the essence of the content.
       - Avoid unnecessary formatting such as italics or underlines.

    6. **Self-contained Information**:  
       - Ensure the Markdown document clearly provides necessary context without assuming prior knowledge or external references.

    7. **Consistency and Conciseness**:  
       - Maintain consistent terminology and phrasing throughout the document.
       - Avoid redundant or verbose phrasing to minimize noise and maximize informational value.

    Input:
      - Consolidated JSON object from the `consolidate_json` task.
